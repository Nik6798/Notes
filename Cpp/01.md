# **About C++**

### 1. C++ is introduced by **Bjarne **Stroustroup\***\* in 1979 and further named c++ in **1983\*\*

### 2. C follow top down approach.( means in this the main function is defined first and then defined the functionality.

### 3. C++ follows bottom up.(it means the main fun is defined after defining the functionality

# **Start**

## 1. **String literal**

a string can be initialize like this also

char array1[] = "Foo" "bar";

### **same as**

char array2[] = { 'F', 'o', 'o', 'b', 'a', 'r', '\0' };

## 2. **Reference variable**Â 

which contains the reference of the another variable and also Known as **Internal variable**

for example
**int &a=b;**

### **points to remember**

1. _Reference_ means _Address_
2. Reference variable must **initialize at decleration**
3. it can **not be updated**

## 3. **Functoins**

It is also known as **Function Prototype**
there ae two types of decleration of a function

1. local **(In main function)**
2. global

### It must be declared first

The arguments that are passed to the function is known as **Actual Args**
and the args used in function definition is known as **Formal Args**

**Formal Args Type**

1. any type variable
2. Pointer
3. Reference Variable

**Function Calls Type**

1. _Call by Value_
   1. fun(a,b);
   2. fun(int x,int y);
2. _Call by Address_
   1. fun(&a,&b);
   2. fun(int* x,int *y);
3. _Call by Reference_
   1. fun(a,b);
   2. fun(int &a,int &b);

## **Inline Function**

### keyword **inline**

Function has it own benefits but it has it's own drawbacks it takes time that's why in cpp **Inline functoins** are introduced

Inline function **Replace the call** of function with function definition

## \*\*Default Args

when you want to be make multiple version of same function then you can use defalut args.

#### function Deceleration **void fun(int,int,int=0);**

## **Function Overloading**

### **it is only possible when fun name is same an args is different**

### **it is possible also without using class**

function overloading resolve using 3 rules

1. exact match
2. args promotion
3. standard conversion

## 4. **Structures**

### keyword **struct**

### these can be declared in 2 ways

1. **local or in main function.**
2. **Global**

_In cpp it is not needed to use struct keyword everytime when you are declaring a varialble of struct type_

```
struct book{
    int bookid;
    char title[100];
    float price;
}b1;

main(){
    struct book b2; //struct is not naccessary
    book b3={12,"fuck book",12}; //like an array

    b3.title="fuck book";// this is not possible because title is an array which is only address of block first.

    strcpy(b3.title,"fuck book");//this is right way

    b2=b3; //possible
}
```

#### **Access specifiers are also used in Struct**
